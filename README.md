The aim of this project was to build a multi-output regression pipeline to predict the coordinates (x, y), which indicate where a particle of interest passed, 
based on data collected from signals in an RSD sensor (Resistive Silicon Detector). 
A variety of preprocessing, dimensionality reduction techniques, and #ML models were tested,
with a random forest regressor achieving the best score, as required by the assessment criteria.
